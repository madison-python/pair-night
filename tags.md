WebDev
:   You like building things for the web. You might know how to build web apps
    with `django` or `flask`, or you like the simplicity of using a static site
    generator like `pelican`. You can whip up a basic form in `HTML` and you
    probably know some `javascript` too. You may know a few different web
    design frameworks, and are comfortable using `jinja2` templates. Whenever
    you communicate with other web services, you know to use `requests`. You
    wouldn't be opposed to a little webscraping with `beautifulsoup` or
    `scrapy`.

DataScience
:   You like playing with data. You know the scientific python stack: tools
    like `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pandas`. You might know how to do machine
    learning with `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow`. You know some formal
    statistics, and could use packages like `statsmodels` and `matplotlib` if 
    you need to. You may know some `R`. You probably know how to use a `jupyter
    notebook` to present the results of your analysis.

Challenger
:   You like solving well-defined problems. You use as much of the standard
    library as you can. You like it when you get to import `collections`,
    `itertools`, or `functools` in one of your projects. You see algorithms
    everywhere, and like writing concise code that gets the job done
    efficiently. You might have a good profile on `StackOverflow` and you spend
    your nights and weekends doing coding challenges like `Advent of Code`, or
    `Code Golf`.

DevOps
:   You love automation. You can appreciate a reproducible workflow. Maybe you
    have used `ansible` or other configuration management system. You may have
    a few `Amazon Web Services` profiles, and know how to use `boto3` to
    connect to them. You know what to do on a fresh server, and how to setup
    a new webserver or database. `Docker` may be installed on your computer.
    You use a lot of UNIX tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. You use `cron`
    so you don't have to repeat boring tasks. You know how to setup
    a `Continuous Integration` deployment.

OpenSource
:   You believe in the open source community. Your `GitHub` activity chart is
    all green. You know how to use `distutils` to package up your code and send
    it to `PyPI` for other people to install with `pip`. You write tests for
    your code using `pytest` and you use `nose` to test your code on multiple
    distributions of python. You can quote a few different `Python Enhancement
    Proposals`, and know how to write a good commit message. You know the value
    of good documentation. Branching and pull requests are your bag.
