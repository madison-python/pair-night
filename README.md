# Pair Night

**Pair Night** is a night for pair programming.

We (the [Madpy meetup](https://meetup.com/MadPython/), in collaboration with [BigDataMadison](https://meetup.com/BigDataMadison) and [MadR](https://meetup.com/MadR-Madison-R-Programming-UseRs-Group/)) are organizing a Pair Night at [Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/) on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2018 beginning at 6PM. Here is a link to the event on Meetup.com: <bit.ly/madpy-pair-night>.

Based on polling at the last few Madpy meetups, this will be a first time pair programming for most of us, so if you have never pair programmed before, rest assured, you are in good company. At Madpy's last meetup, I talked about the origins of pair programming: what it is, why people do it, and what people get out of it ([slides](https://github.com/madison-python/pair-night/blob/master/intro-to-pair-programming.pdf)). We also had a discussion about how best to organize the first Pair Night.

Following our discussion, here's how the first Pair Night is going to unfold. First and foremost, the Pair Night is an open Meetup event like any other, open to beginners and experts alike, and you do not need to come to the Pair Night with a project or a partner already in mind, especially if you are new to python or programming. At the same time, if you would be more comfortable coming with a partner or a project already picked out, you are encouraged to do so.

We assume that many people who come to the Pair Night will not have a pairing partner or a project idea before they arrive. The first part of the evening will be spent finding a partner and a project to work on. My goal and the goal of the other co-organizers (Dan Imhoff, Pitt Fagan, and Ben Wiseman) will be to help people with similar interests find each other at the Pair Night so that you can pair up and find a project to work on together. To help everyone form pairs and find projects, we're going to try using a digital bulletin board for posting project ideas, and a tag system for helping you find someone with similar interests to yours.

## Project ideas board

I put up a digital bulletin board for the Pair Night on the Madpy Trello, [trello.com/madpy](https://trello.com/madpy). The [Pair Night! board](https://trello.com/b/LwQCJ5cZ/pair-night) is public so you can view it without making a Trello account. This board will contain a running list of project ideas. Everyone is encouraged to post projects they think would be interesting to work on at the Pair Night to the board. If you are willing to make an account on Trello, I will add you to the Madpy Team. If you don't want to make a Trello account, you can send me the project description, and I will post it for you so it is visible to everyone else.

You can post as many problems as you'd like (including None). For example, I added a card for anyone wanting to work on the "Advent of Code 2017" puzzlers. In the notes on the card, I put a link to the Advent of Code problems, so that interested parties could read through some of the problems to get a feel for them. You can put as little or as much detail on the cards as you'd like.

There is no obligation to work on any of the problems you post. The purpose of the board is to help generate ideas for fun projects, not to announce what you are going to work on. To that end, if you would rather post a project anonymously, you can do that too; just email me with the project description and mention you'd prefer it to be anonymous.

If some pairs form from project ideas posted to the board prior to the Pair Night, that's great! But most pairs won't be finalized until the night of the event, so don't think that you must pair up prior to the Pair Night.

## Tags

The second way I have of helping people form pairs and find projects is to set up a tag system for identifying what our different interests are, to give other people who don't know us yet a sense of the type of project we might be interested in working on. When everyone arrives to the Pair Night, the first thing we will do is make a nametag for ourselves and put colored stickers on our nametags corresponding to whichever of the tags we wish to associate with. These tags are a way of identifying general categories of interests in programming. When everyone shows up to the Pair Night, we will mingle and seek out people with nametags that look similar, and form pairs around these similar interests.

Here are the tags I've come up with, with thanks to Ryan Prior, Devin Conathan, and Davi Post. These tags are intended to capture one or more of your interests in programming that brought you to the Pair Night. I've tried to describe the tags, but no tag description is complete, and the descriptions are not meant to be requirements. If the descriptions don't make sense, let me know and I will fix them. If there are tags not on this list that you believe would better capture your interest in programming and coming to the Pair Night, let me know that as well.

**WebDev**
:   Web stuff! Web apps, static web sites, web scraping, html, javascript.

**DataScience**
:   Data! Data sets, data munging, statistics and machine learning, visualization, R.

**Challenger**
:   Likes a challenge! Interested in solving practice problems and interview questions.

**DevOps**
:   Full stack. Cloud services. Containers. Automation and continuous integration.

**OpenSource**
:   Get involved in the open source community. Make a package, fix a bug.

**GameDev**
:   Make a game, play a game, make more game.

**GUIApps**
:   Build desktop programs. Design layouts and user interactions.

**HelloWorld!**
:   Pythonista in training.

These tags also integrate nicely with the projects board. Each project can have one more tags associated with it. That way, pairs who don't have a project can look at the projects board filtered by tag to find a project related to their interests that they would enjoy working on.

## Schedule of events

Times are relative to the 6PM start time.

30min. Introduction, pairings, and project selection. (Food? See below.)  
60min. Pairing #1.  
60min. Pairing #2. Can continue with Pair #1 if you'd like.

**A note on food.** I would love to order pizzas for the group, but I could use some help with the expenses. If you are up for chipping in for some pizza or you have a lead on a potential sponsor for the event, please get in touch with me.

## What to bring

If you have a laptop, please bring it. Since we are pair programming, not everyone will need a laptop, so **if you don't have a laptop, don't let that stop you from coming**. If we run short on laptops, we will form larger groups if we have to, and we will figure out a better system for the next Pair Night.
