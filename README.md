**Pair Night** is a night for pair programming.

The [Madpy meetup](https://meetup.com/MadPython/), in collaboration with the [BigDataMadison](https://meetup.com/BigDataMadison) and [MadR](https://meetup.com/MadR-Madison-R-Programming-UseRs-Group/) meetups, are organizing a Pair Night at [Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/). The Pair Night is on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2018 beginning at 6p. Here is a link to the event on Meetup.com: <https://www.meetup.com/MadPython/events/246915627/> 

For most of us, this will be the first time pair programming with anyone. At Madpy's last meetup ([slides](https://github.com/madison-python/pair-night/blob/master/intro.pdf)), I talked about the origins of pair programming, why people do it, what people get out of it, and we had a discussion about how best to organize the first Pair Night. Following that discussion, here is what I've come up with regarding how the first Pair Night is going to work.

First and foremost, the Pair Night is an open Meetup event like any other, open to beginners and experts alike, and you do not need to come to the Pair Night with a project or a partner already in mind. However, if you would be more comfortable picking either a project or a partner before coming to the event, you are encouraged to do so. You are welcome to bring guests to this event.

My goal as organizer is to help people with similar interests find each other at the Pair Night so that they can pair up and have fun writing code together. I have two ways I'm going to try to help people in the group find others with similar interests. The first is a Classifieds projects board, and the second is a Tag system.

## Classifieds

I put up a digital bulletin board for the Pair Night on the Madpy Trello, [trello.com/madpy](https://trello.com/madpy). The [**Pair Night!** board](https://trello.com/b/LwQCJ5cZ/pair-night) is public so you can view it without making a Trello account. This board will contain a running list of project ideas, kind of like a "Classifieds" section for the pair night. Everyone is encouraged to post projects they think would be interesting to work on for the Pair Night leading up to the event. You can post as many problems as you'd like (including None). For example, I added a card for anyone wanting to work on the "Advent of Code 2017" puzzlers. In the notes on the card, I put a link to the Advent of Code problems, so that interested parties could read through some of the problems to get a feel for them. You can put as little or as much detail on the cards as you'd like. 

There is no obligation to work on any of the problems you post. The purpose of the board is to help generate ideas for fun projects, not to announce what you are going to work on. If some pairs form based on interest in a particular project, that's great! But most pairs won't be finalized until the night of the event.

## Tags

The second way I have of helping people form pairs and find projects is a tag system. When people arrive to the Pair Night, the first thing they will do is make a nametag for themselves and put colored stickers on their nametag corresponding to whatever tags they want to associate with. These tags are a way of identifying general categories of programming interest. During the first part of the event, you can seek out people with nametags that look similar to yours, and form pairs around similar interests that way.

Here are the tags I've come up with, with thanks to Ryan Prior, Devin Conathan, and Davi Post. These tags are intented to capture one or more of your interests in programming that could help to identify both a pairing partner and the type of project you'd be interested in working on at the Pair Night. Tags are accompanied with descriptions. No tag description is complete, and the descriptions are not meant to be interpreted as requirements. Hopefully some of the descriptions make sense. If they don't make sense, let me know and I will fix them. If there are tags not on this list that you believe would better capture your interest in programming, let me know that as well.

**WebDev**
:   Web stuff! Web apps, static web sites, web scraping, javascript.

**DataScience**
:   Data! Data munging, statistics and machine learning, visualization, R. 

**Challenger**
:   Challenge yourself by solving a well-defined but difficult problem.

**DevOps**
:   Full stack. Cloud services. Containers. Automation and CI.

**OpenSource**
:   Engage with the open source community. Make a package, fix a bug.

**GameDev**
:   Make a game, play a game.

**HelloWorld!**
:   Pythonista in training.

The tags also integrate nicely with the Classifieds projects board. Each project can have one more tags associated with it. That way, pairs who don't have a project can look at the projects board filtered by tag to find a project related to their interests that they would enjoy working on.

## Summary

- Pair Night is Feb. 28 at 6p at Industrious.
