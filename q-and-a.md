# Pair Programming Q&A with Jim Remsik

#. When do you pair?
    - Company policy
    - When you run into problems
    - When someone new comes on the project
#. Can you describe something that you learned in a pairing session that you would not have learned on your own?

## The Driver and the Navigator

The two roles in a pair are the Driver and the Navigator.

#. Obviously only one person can be typing at a time, but do you think it is useful to think about the two roles as being separate?
#. Do you have a preferred role? Why?
#. Who should do more of the talking, the Driver or the Navigator?
