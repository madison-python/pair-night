# Pair Night

## TL;DR

- Some time in the next month or two we will be holding a pair programming
  night as an alternative to our normal meeting format. Vote for when to hold
  the event (weeknight, weekend day, or weekend night) by taking this
  one-question survey here:
  [bit.ly/pair-night-datetime](http://bit.ly/pair-night-datetime).
- Many people in the group (me included!) have never pair programmed before,
  and have many questions about how it's all going to work. If you are curious,
  come to our next meeting on Thursday, January 11 at 6p. Details
  [here](https://www.meetup.com/MadPython/events/245923266/).
- This event will be co-organized with Pitt Fagan ([Big Data
  Madison](https://www.meetup.com/BigDataMadison/)) and Benjamin Wiseman
  ([MadR](https://www.meetup.com/MadR-Madison-R-Programming-UseRs-Group/)), and
  will be hosted at
  [Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/locations/madison).

## The long version

I'd like to kick off 2018 with a special event: a pair programming night. Most
of our meetings are lecture-style, meaning that one person (or at least one
person at a time) presents material to everyone in the group. A pair
programming night is a different type of event where everyone learns from each
other by forming pairs and writing some code together.

Full disclosure: I've never pair programmed before, and I know there are others
like me in the group. This is going to be a new experience for a lot of us.
I know some people do pair at work, and hopefully they can share what they've
learned. But for the rest of us, know that you are not alone!

Because so many of us are new at this sort of thing, I am going to dedicate the
first half of
[our next meeting on Thursday, January 11 at 6p](https://www.meetup.com/MadPython/events/245923266/)
to introducing pair programming and holding a discussion about how the Pair
Night will be organized. The discussion will include answers to questions
such as:

- What is pair programming?
- Why do people pair program?
- How are pairs determined?
- What do pairs work on?

In addition to breaking out of the lecture-style format, I also wanted to hold
a Madpy event on an alternative datetime for those who can't make our normal
**2nd Thursday of the month at 6p** schedule. To cast your vote for when
we hold the first pair programming event, answer this one-question survey: [bit.ly/pair-night-datetime](http://bit.ly/pair-night-datetime).

Although I will wait to hear from everyone before I schedule a final
datetime for the event, I do have a location already picked out.
Industrious, a new coworking space on the Square, has kindly agreed to
host the event for us. They have a lot of great space for people to
pair up, and there are great views of the city to boot.

I've also reached out to some other meetup organizers in town who are
interested in participating. Pitt Fagan is going to promote the event to the
Big Data group, and Benjamin Wiseman has agreed to let the MadR group know as
well. Let this be your notice that you have permission to alert your friends
and coworkers far and wide about this event, even people who don't know python!

Here's to a pythonic 2018,
Pierce
